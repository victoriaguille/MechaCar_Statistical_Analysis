## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
####
When reviewing the results of the multiple linear regression, two variables provided non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values. Of the variables listed in the below image, ground clearance and vehicle length (as well as the intercept) have a significant impact on the mpg values. Because of the two variables mentions, not every single variable is random. Without totally random variables, the slope cannot be zero. The r-squared value of 0.7149 further proves that the slope of the linear model is not zero as it is a positive number above 0. All of these factors previously discussed prove that the linear model does not predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively as the two variables that are non-random mean their is overfitting occuring. Either the formula must change or other factors must be considered in order to properly predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
